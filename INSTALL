Shaman Installation

---------------------------------------------------------

Shaman installation is fairly easy: you just need cmake,
our building system, and a working copy of qt. You DON'T
need to have kdelibs4 installed!!

Obviously, Shaman needs a working copy of Pacman, something
that all Arch Linux installations have.

First of all, enter in the Directory you unpacked Shaman in
and issue:

cmake . -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr

Mind the ".", it's necessary. Cmake will now check your system
for requirements, and will generate the makefiles if the configure step
was successful. Pass to cmake the parameter -DKDE4_INTEGRATION=TRUE
to build Shaman with KDE4 integration. Please note this will require
KDELibs at build time and runtime.

Then it's time for

make

This can take some time. When it finishes, you need to issue
as superuser

make install

To install Shaman system wide. This will also install a configuration
file for DBus, to make Shaman able to connect to the System Bus,
and a .desktop file for Shaman.

That's it! You can now start Shaman from your menu, or from the
terminal by issuing "shaman"
