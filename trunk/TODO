TODO-List for qtPacman 


***********Core***************
Basic-functionality (installing, removing packages) *almost done* *prio* --> done?
Dbus-Engine (later) *prio*
Plasma-Data-Engine *not really needed, we can use DBus only* *prio*
Implement Error Handling *prio in critical cases such as Queue Processing*
#Implement Interface Configuration (XML?) QSettings, done :)
Implement Queue *prio* ---> done!
#Implement Question Handling  ---> done? done :)
Throw all relevant packages informations into the QTreeWidgetItem (missing now: installed and dependencies)--->Depencies are not soo good I think, they're 
													      shown in PkgInfos, which is much better IMO



***********GUI**************
More icons
Splitter-positioning is a bit bad at the moment ---> done, we switched to QDockWidgets
Same with QTreeWidgetItem-columns ;) *prio*
Add a clear button in the searchbar, something like kickoff's one, if possible :)
Complete PkgDetails *prio* ---> Needed: size
All action-button-actions in context-menu *prio*
Connect all buttons to actions --> done!
Configuration-dialog *prio*
System-Tray-Icon *prio* --->Mostly done, only a few missing things (change icon, if there are upgradeable packages)
Implement ComboBox (depends on Queue implementation and added info to pkgs) --> done!
Plasmoid (later, and as a separate application?) *prio*
Improve Package Information Dialog ---> done!
Add dynamic Icons to packages (icon for action, icon for upgradeable, installed, not installed) 
Add dynamic Icons to QueueDialog (f.e.: add a green "v" for completed operation, a red "x" if errors occourred)
