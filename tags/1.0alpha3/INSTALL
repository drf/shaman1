Shaman Installation

---------------------------------------------------------

Shaman installation is fairly easy: you just need cmake,
our building system, and a working copy of qt. You DON'T
need to have kdelibs4 installed!!

Obviously, Shaman needs a working copy of Pacman, something
that all Arch Linux installations have.

First of all, enter in the Directory you unpacked Shaman in
and issue:

cmake .

Mind the ".", it's necessary. Cmake will now check your system
for requirements, and if KDELibs4 are found, it will add to
the MakeFile also the Plasmoid. Again, this is not a requirement,
if you don't have KDELibs4 the Plasmoid will just be skipped.
Then it's time for

make

This can take sometime. When it finishes, you need to issue
as superuser

make install

To install Shaman Systemwide. This will also install a configuration
file for DBus, to make Shaman able to connect to the System Bus,
and a .desktop file for Shaman.

That's it! You can now start Shaman from your menu, or from the
terminal by issuing "shaman"
